# Art Downloader

A nice little web-based downloader and viewer for art you find on the internet. It's capable of automatically adding posts from Tumblr, Reddit, Twitter, and Instagram (using their unofficial APIs), and generating thumbnails for them so for every piece of art you save, you get a preview. Also supports tagging your art so you can find it easily later.
