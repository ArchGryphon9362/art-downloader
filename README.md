# Art Downloader

A nice little web-based downloader and viewer for art you find on the internet. It's capable of automatically adding posts from Tumblr, Reddit, Twitter, and Instagram (using their unofficial APIs, except Tumblr - you gotta get free API keys for that), and generating thumbnails for them so for every piece of art you save, you get a preview. Also supports tagging your art so you can find it easily later.
